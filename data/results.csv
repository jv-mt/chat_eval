Okay, the user is asking how to create a data management plan. Let me check the provided documents to find the answer.

Looking at the first document, it says: ""Create the data management plan using either the Word template at the bottom of this page or with the DPM Tuuli data management planning tool. They both contain instructions."" So that's a direct answer. Also, the documents mention that the plan should be attached as an annex to the thesis plan. Another part says the purpose is to ensure good scientific practice and describe data collection, storage, sharing, legal issues, and data handling after the thesis. But the question is specifically about how to create it, so the main points are using the templates or tools and attaching it to the thesis plan. I need to make sure not to add any extra information not in the documents. The answer should be concise, using the exact phrases from the documents. Let me confirm there's no other step mentioned. The documents also mention the order of proceeding: create thesis plan first, then the data management plan, then apply for permits, etc. But the question is about creating the plan, so the answer is using the templates or tools and attaching it as an annex. Also, the second document mentions that for a literature review, you don't need it, but that's not part of the creation process. So the answer is straightforward.

To create the data management plan, use either the Word template at the bottom of the page or the DPM Tuuli data management planning tool. Both include instructions.

Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking what phase 2 of the thesis process includes, and they want the answer based only on the provided documents.

First, I need to look through the documents to find any mention of phase 2. The first document mentions ""Phase 2 (Two thirds of thesis completed) - Thesis implementation"" for both Bachelor and Master levels. It states that for Bachelor, it's 6 ECTS credits = 162 working hours, taking 10-11 weeks at 15 hours per week. For Master, it's 10 ECTS credits = 270 working hours, taking 18 weeks. But the actual tasks aren't detailed here.

Looking at the second document, it has a section titled ""Thesis process scheduling..."" which includes Phase 1 and Phase 2. Under Phase 2, it says ""Thesis implementation"" and lists the hours again. However, the tasks for phase 2 aren't explicitly stated here either. The third document talks about the process order: creating a thesis plan, applying for a research permit, collecting data, storing it, etc. But that's more about the general process rather than specific phases.

Wait, the first document under ""Tasks contained in phase 3"" mentions tasks like writing the thesis, getting comments, etc. But phase 2 isn't detailed there. The second document's phase 2 is only about the credit hours and time, not the tasks. The third document's steps are more about the overall process but not specifically phase 2 tasks.

Hmm, the user is asking for what phase 2 includes. The documents don't explicitly list the tasks for phase 2. The first document mentions phase 3 tasks, but phase 2 isn't detailed. The second document only gives the time and credits for phase 2. The third document's steps are more general. So, based on the documents, there's no explicit information on what phase 2 includes. The answer would be that there's not enough information because the documents don't specify the tasks for phase 2, only the time and credit requirements.

Okay, let's see. The user is asking how to name a thesis when it has only one author. I need to look through the provided documents to find the exact information.

Looking at the first document, there's a section about file naming. It says: ""If the work has only one author, the filename is: Lastname_Firstname"". That seems direct. Let me check if there's any other mention. The same document also talks about multiple authors, but the question is about one author. The other documents discuss citations and publishing steps, but the naming convention is specifically mentioned here. 

I should make sure there's no conflicting information. The second document mentions APA style citations, but that's about in-text citations, not file names. The third document talks about applying for a degree certificate and publishing, but the filename instruction is in the first document. 

So the answer should be exactly as stated in the first document: Lastname_Firstname. No need to add anything else. The user wants a concise answer using the documents only.

Okay, the user is asking how to write a parenthetical citation in a book review, and they want the answer based only on the provided documents. Let me check the documents to find relevant information.

Looking at the first document, there's a section on book reviews. It mentions a citation example: Njau, L.S., & Isuja, S.P. (2019). [Review of the book The challenge for Africa, by W. Maathai]. International Journal of Knowledge, Innovation & Entrepreneurship, 7(1), pp. 93–95. Retrieved from https://www.ijkie.org. The parenthetical citation here is (Njau & Isuja, 2019). 

Another part of the document lists parenthetical citations for other sources, like (Balazs, 2020) for a dissertation and (Wilson-Harris, 2020) for a newspaper article. The third document mentions that in the 2020-2021 academic year, APA Seventh Edition is used, and there's an example of a whole authored book with parenthetical citation (Brown, 2011; Styhre & Sundgren, 2011). 

So, the key point is that in a book review, the parenthetical citation would include the authors' last names and the year, like (Njau & Isuja, 2019). The example from the document shows that when reviewing a book, the citation in the text is the reviewers' names and the year. The URL is included in the reference list, but the parenthetical citation in the text is just the authors and year. 

I need to make sure not to include any other information. The answer should be exactly as per the documents. The example given in the first document for the book review is (Njau & Isuja, 2019). So the answer is that the parenthetical citation in a book review is the authors' last names and the year, as shown in the example.
</think>

The parenthetical citation in a book review is written as (Author Last Name, Year). For example, (Njau & Isuja, 2019) is used to cite a review of a book in the text.","{'model': 'qwen3:4b', 'created_at': '2025-05-23T11:34:20.275335342Z', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'total_duration': 23796247204, 'load_duration': 11479673001, 'prompt_eval_count': 1105, 'prompt_eval_duration': 928979382, 'eval_count': 491, 'eval_duration': 11386934616, 'model_name': 'qwen3:4b'}","[""Parenthetical citation: (Wilson-Harris, 2020)\nNarrative citation: Wilson-Harris (2020)\nFurther information and examples from APA Style\nBook review\nNjau, L.S., & Isuja, S.P.
